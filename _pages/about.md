My name is Junze Yin. I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Rice University, fortunate to be advised by Professor Maryam Aliakbarpour. I earned my M.A. and B.A. in Mathematics from Boston University, where I had the privilege of being advised by Professor Mark Kon. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in numerical linear algebra, theoretical machine learning, large language models, and fractal geometry.
